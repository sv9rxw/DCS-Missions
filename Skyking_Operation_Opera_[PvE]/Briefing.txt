Iran is constructing in a nuclear facility near Palmyra at DU63
with 2 nuclear reactors. 

BLUEFOR must perform a precision deep strike to those 2 reactors and
completely destroy them.

BLUEFOR intelligence has found a path to the target, along which enemy 
air defences are not capable of discovering us.

We shall do a stealthy deep penetration into enemy air space by flying
very low, below 500 feet AGL and staying on course as defined by
our given waypoints.

In specific we shall:
 1. Take-off from Ramat David AFB
 2. Join above Sea of Galilee and fly low just before exiting
    Isreali borders. 
 3. Fly through the enemy air space in our given path and below
    500 feet AGL. 
 4. We can prepare for strike and increase altitude when we exiting
    the AGL restriction zone - marked by BULLSEYE and Waypoint 8,
    west of Palmyra town. Nevertheless, fly as low as possible.
 5. We will enter restricted airspace above the nuclear reactor to
    perform the strike. As soon as we entered that airspace, we
    will have 3 - 10 minutes window before red forces are mobilized
    and alert.
 6. We shall destroy both reactors and get out as fast as possible
    all the way back - waypoints in reverse order.
 7. Be very alert since on the way back, RED forces will be on alert
    and we may engange interceptors or Air Defence units on the way.
 8. Enter Isreali border and lond at Ramat David. Politics and 
    diplomacy shall do the rest.

 - DO NOT ENGAGE any unit on the way in and before target zone.
 - DO NOT VIOLATE the AGL threshold (500 feet AGL) in the way in,
   outside of israeli borders.
   (depiected by the white circle in Mission Planner)
 - DO NOT DEVIATE from the course and enter dangerous Air Defence zones.
   (depicted by the red circles in Mission Planner.)
 - DO NOT EVER hit a neutral / civilian airplane or ground unit. NEVER.


SKYKING is with us, observing the mission status and will be helping us
during the mission be informing us of any AGL threshold violation or
course deviation.
